# Gemini AI for Homey Pro

**Chat directly with Gemini AI using the Homey Dashboard Widget, or integrate it into your Flows as an advanced, autonomous smart home assistant.**

This Homey app bridges your smart home with Google's Generative AI models (`@google/genai`), allowing you to interact with your home using natural language. Use the Dashboard Widget to chat with Gemini, query device states, control capabilities, or schedule future actions. Additionally, integrate Gemini into your Flows to evaluate complex yes/no conditions, analyze camera snapshots, manage Standard and Advanced Flows, or automate device routines.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Dashboard Chat Widget**: Interactive chat widget on your Homey dashboard to control devices, query real-time states, and execute automations. Built with an asynchronous polling queue to prevent UI timeouts.
- **Smart Home Assistant (MCP Engine)**: Autonomous function calling powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Gemini discovers resources, queries device status, and executes actions across your smart home.
- **Multi-Role Model Routing**: Dedicated model assignment for each operational role:
  - **Conversational AI (`chat`)**: Fast, lightweight models (e.g. `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`) for general questions, condition cards, and vision analysis.
  - **Basic Smart Home (`shGeneric`)**: High-efficiency model for querying and controlling smart home devices.
  - **Automation & Flows (`shFlow`)**: Advanced reasoning model (e.g. `gemini-3.7-flash`) specialized in designing, creating, and modifying Homey Standard and Advanced Flows.
  - **Image Generation (`image`)**: Model dedicated to generating images (`gemini-3.1-flash-image`).
- **Context Caching**: Static system instructions and MCP tool schemas (~19,500 tokens) are cached in Google GenAI memory, reducing prompt token costs by up to 88% and providing ultra-fast response times.
- **Standard & Advanced Flow Management**: Natural language creation, modification, connection, deletion, and rollback restoration of both Standard and visual DAG Advanced Flows, complete with automatic spatial auto-layout computation.
- **Intelligent Condition Cards**: Three boolean condition cards (`Ask Gemini`, `Ask Gemini with Image`, `Ask Gemini using Smart Home`) to dynamically branch Flows based on real-world reasoning.
- **Sensor History & Device Logs**: Query past sensor trends, averages, and historical time-series data (temperature, energy consumption, etc.).
- **Matter OTA Firmware Management**: Check firmware availability for all devices and trigger over-the-air updates for Matter devices.
- **Multi-Turn Memory & Pruning**: Remembers conversational context across interactions with automatic idle timeout cleanup and uncached token management.
- **Scheduled Automations**: Schedule commands with natural language (e.g., *"Turn off living room lights at 11 PM"* or *"in 15 minutes"*), persisted across app restarts.
- **Custom Instructions & AI Prompt Generator**: Write natural rules (e.g., *"Always check the bedroom Daikin when I ask for temperature"*) and convert them automatically into formatted Markdown system prompts.
- **Hidden & Grouped Devices Control**: Configurable access to devices marked as hidden or grouped in Homey.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Homey Pro** with firmware `>= 12.4.0` (Homey Apps SDK v3).
- **Google Gemini API Key**: Obtainable from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). A Pay-As-You-Go plan is recommended to unlock Context Caching and high token-per-minute (TPM) limits.
- **HomeyScript App**: Required to grant flow-triggering permissions (`homey.flow.start`) on Homey Pro.

## 💡 Flow Cards Reference

### 🎬 Action Cards

1. **Send a prompt (`send-prompt`)**
   - *Description*: Sends a plain text prompt to the Conversational AI model.
   - *Tokens returned*: `answer` (AI response text).
2. **Send a prompt with image (`send-prompt-with-image`)**
   - *Description*: Multimodal analysis combining an image token (camera snapshot/webcam) with a text prompt.
   - *Tokens returned*: `answer` (analysis text), `analyzed_image` (captured image buffer).
3. **Execute Smart Home MCP Command (`send-mcp-command`)**
   - *Description*: Executes natural language smart home commands using MCP function calling.
   - *Tokens returned*: `response` (text answer), `success` (boolean), `timer_id` (schedule ID if a timer was set).
4. **Seed Conversation Context (`seed-conversation-context`)**
   - *Description*: Pre-injects a contextual message into Gemini's multi-turn conversation memory before a subsequent MCP command runs.

### ❓ Condition Cards

1. **Evaluate Prompt (`evaluate-prompt`)**
   - *Description*: Evaluates a yes/no question using general AI reasoning. Returns `true` if Gemini answers YES.
2. **Evaluate Prompt with Image (`evaluate-prompt-with-image`)**
